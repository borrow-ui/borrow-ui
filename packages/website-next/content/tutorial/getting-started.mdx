Welcome to `borrow-ui` guide!

In this guide you will learn how to get ready to start using the components
and the other utilities included in this project.

Before you start, make sure you have a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) environment ready.
We will use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and, optionally, [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

You can use `borrow-ui` in different ways:

-   by including the `ui/src` folder in your project;
-   by using this project as a base;
-   by installing `borrow-ui` directly from the npm registry.

## Goal of this project

`borrow-ui` project is intended to be a quick-start for a full controlled set of components.
Installing and using from npm registry should be done only for a quick look of the components.

### Why maintain your components kit?

Often, when we start a new project, we can't or won't use 3rd-party UI Kits such as
Material UI, UI Kit or React Bootstrap; each of these is great and is ready to use, with
a lot of documentation and examples.
However, there is almost no control over the components that are given. Small fixes or changes, or
systematic improvements are controlled by the Kit maintainers and might take a lot of time before
they are available.

`borrow-ui` allows you to start and maintain _your own Kit_. Each component:

-   is minimal and can be used as a starter for more complex scenarios;
-   is consistent with other comonents (code styles, tests, nomenclatures);
-   is tested;
-   has a documentation file written for [`Storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/);
-   usually has no 3rd party dependencies\*.

If you plan to use your application for a long time, the kit you are relying might change version
few times with breaking changes, so the documentation will no longer be up to date, new bugs will not be
fixed (in your chosen version) and there will be no new components.

On the other side, if you maintain your own component kit you will need to write a lot yourself (you can
always wrap 3rd party headless components, like the formidable `react-select`), but you will have
full control over the life of the kit.

\* except for `flexboxgrid2` and `react-media`, which are easily swappable with others,
and the ones used in forms: `react-select`, `react-dropzone`, `react-day-picker` and `dayjs`.

### Tools and dependencies

Beside the components, `borrow-ui` offers tests (in form of unit tests) and
documentation. As soon as your project is renamed as you wish, you will have this same
documentation available. It is strongly recommended to invest time documenting your components,
as well as testing them.

Styling is done with [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) and few variables can help to customize the Kit.

## Installation

As mentioned above, there are different ways to install and use `borrow-ui`.

-   [include](/tutorial/getting-started-include-in-an-existing-project)
    the `ui`'s `src` folder directly in your existing project:
    this will allow you to import and use all the components directly;
-   [use this monorepo](/tutorial/getting-started-use-as-a-project-base) as a base for your project,
    with storybook and examples already setup;
-   by installing it from `npm` registry (`yarn add @borrow-ui/ui` or `npm install @borrow-ui/ui`).

All the installation procedures are explained in the next sections.
