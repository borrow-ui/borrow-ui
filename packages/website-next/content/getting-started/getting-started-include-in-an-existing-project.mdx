`borrow-ui` can be used directly in your React project by including the
`ui/src` folder of this project directly in your `src` folder.

For example, if you are using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/):

1. copy the `borrow-ui/packages/ui/src` folder inside CRA's' `src` folder with the desired name
   (i.e. `@borrow-ui/ui`);
2. install the dependencies;
3. start the application!

## Step by step

### Download and include in your project

Download the latest zip [here](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/archive/master.zip)
and extract the content, for example in `~/Downloads/borrow-ui-master`.

Copy the `packages/ui/src` folder inside your project:

```bash
# You probably did this before:
# npx create-react-app my-react-app
# Navigate inside your project src
cd my-react-app/src;
# create a @borrow-ui container folder
mkdir @borrow-ui
# copy the src folder inside the packages here
cp -r ~/Downloads/borrow-ui-master/packages/ui/src @borrow-ui/ui
```

### Install dependencies

Now, before starting the React app, the required dependencies needs to be installed.
You can check which are the "dependencies", "optionalDependencies" and "peerDependencies" from the source
[package.json](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/blob/master/packages/ui/package.json)
file and install them or launch the following command:

```bash
yarn add -D "sass<1.33"
yarn add flexboxgrid2 react-media material-design-icons-iconfont @popperjs/core react-popper lodash.debounce prismjs
# if you want to use forms:
yarn add dayjs react-select react-day-picker react-dropzone
```

If you don't want to use forms components, you need to remove the import and export
from `borrow-ui`'s `index.js` file, located in the index file `src/@borrow-ui/ui/index.js`,
and from `ui.full.scss` file, located in the SCSS index file `src/@borrow-ui/ui/styles/ui.full.scss`.

Import in your application the required dependencies, for example in your main `src/index.js`:

```jsx
import '@borrow-ui/ui/style/ui.full.scss';
import 'material-design-icons-iconfont/dist/material-design-icons.css';
```

To make imports work properly, create a `jsconfig.json`
file on your root folder (same folder as `package.json`) to enable imports from `src` folder:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "src",
        "paths": {
            "*": ["src/*"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Import components in your project

Congratulations! You should be able now to import components from `@borrow-ui/ui`!

```jsx
import { Text } from '@borrow-ui/ui';
```
