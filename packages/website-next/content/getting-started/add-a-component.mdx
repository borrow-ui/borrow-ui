To add a new component you can follow few easy steps.

First, add a new folder under `src/components`.
In the main `index.js` file import the new component, and finally import the style in `ui.full.scss`.

In the following paragraphs we will see how to add a `RedLink` component.

### Add the Component

Create a folder called `red-link` inside `src/components` and a file called `RedLink.js` inside it.

_There are other strategies to name components folders and files._
_For example, you can name the folder RedLink and the js file `index.js`, but (in my opinion) this makes it harder to open the files by name and it's less immediate to determine the source of errors in the console_

Add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// import the UI classes Prefix value
import { UI_PREFIX } from '../../config';
// import children prop type definition
import { propTypesChildren } from '../../utils/types';

// define the style class with BEM style and the UI Prefix
const RED_LINK_CLASS = `${UI_PREFIX}__red-link`;

// Create the component and export it
export function RedLink({ className = '', children, ...rest }) {
    // define the class and remember to append the one coming from props
    const redLinkClassName = `${RED_LINK_CLASS} ${className}`.trim();

    // return the JSX
    return (
        // remember to append ...rest spread
        <a className={redLinkClassName} {...rest}>
            {children}
        </a>
    );
}

// Define the prop types
RedLink.propTypes = {
    className: PropTypes.string,
    children: propTypesChildren,
};
```

### Style the new Component

In the same folder, create a `red-link.scss` file, and add the following content:

```scss
/* main variables are also available as we will add this to the main SCSS */

/* define the classes with the prefix */
.#{$ui-prefix}__link {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
.#{$ui-prefix}__link:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

### Import and export the files

Now that we have a component and it's style, we need to add them to:

-   `src/index.js` file:

```jsx
// ... other components imports
import { RedLink } from './components/red-link/RedLink.js';

export {
    // ... other components exports
    RedLink,
};
```

-   `src/style/ui.full.scss` file:

```scss
/* other components imports */
@import '../components/red-link/red-link';
```

## Use the component

To use the new component in another project while developing, run (from `packages/ui` folder):

```bash
yarn watch
```

and import the component in your file (i.e. `packages/website/src/pages/Home.js`):

```jsx
import { RedLink } from '@borrow-ui/ui';
```

To use the component in another project in production, you will need to build first:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Adding tests

Testing components is fundamental to maintain good quality and be sure they behave in the right way.
This also prevents that changes in other components affects the ones that imports them!

`borrow-ui` uses `react-testing-library` and `jest` to test the components.
To test the `RedLink` component, create a file called `redLink.test.js`, and add the following content:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

import { UI_PREFIX, config, setConfig } from '../../config';

import { Link } from './Link';

describe('RedLink', () => {
    test('renders the children with config tag', () => {
        render(<Link to="/app">App</Link>);
        const link = screen.getByText('App');

        expect(link).toHaveClass(`${UI_PREFIX}__red-link`);
    });
});
```

## Adding documentation

Creating documentation for your components is always useful!
Comments in the code are good, but another great way of documenting your code is with dedicated tools.
The tool that comes with this package is `Storybook`, so ideally we need to add a `Storybook`
file to each of our components, to document it's usage to ourself and other developers.

To add a `Storybook` mdx file for the component, create a `src/components/red-link/RedLink.stories.mdx` file:

```md
import { Meta, Story, Canvas, ArgsTable } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

import { RedLink } from './RedLink';

<Meta title="Components/RedLink" component={RedLink} />

# RedLink

Links are used to create connections between pages and to external content.
The `RedLink` component can be used as a standard link (`a` tag) with a red color.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Default">
        <div>
            A normal link with "a" tag with red color <RedLink>looks like this</RedLink>.
        </div>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={RedLink} />
```

To see it in the documentation, run (from `packages/documentation` folder):

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Build the documentation

Documentation can be built by running `Storybook` build command (from `packages/documentation` folder):

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```
