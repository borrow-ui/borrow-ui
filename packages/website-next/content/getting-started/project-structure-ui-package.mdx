The `ui` package is the core package, the container of all the shared components.
It has a simple structure and few tools already setup:

-   [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
    [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for tests;
-   [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle all the files;
-   [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code;
-   [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile;
-   [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling the components.

## Main folder

The main folder looks like this:

```
src
.babelrc
.eslintrc
.gitignore
jest.config.js
package.json
prettier.config.js
rollup.config.js
```

-   `src` folder contains all the source for components (`*.js` files), styles (`*.scss` files) and stories (`*.stories.mdx`);
-   `.babelrc` contains babel configuration (standard React preset);
-   `.eslintrc` contains ESlint configuration (standard React preset plus some customization);
-   `.gitignore` the files that git must ignore and not include in the repository;
-   `jest.config.js` contains instruction for `jest` based on file extensions;
-   `package.json` has all the information about the package: name and website,
    which commands are valid, which are the dependencies (peer, dev or standard);
-   `prettier.config.js` contains prettier configuration;
-   `rollup.config.js` file contains the configuration for rollup: which loaders to run, how to minimize the code
    for production build and to include source maps in development. If you look inside, you will notice that all
    external libraries (like `React` itself or `react-media`) are specified also in the `externals` section, so they will
    not be bundled and must be installed separately if needed. This shuold happen automatically given we setup them in
    the `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` in the `package.json` file.

## src folder

The structure of the `src` folder is the following:

```
src/
    components
    hooks
    style
    utils
    config.js
    index.js
    setupTests.js
```

### Main files

`config.js` file allows to customize the UI library. It has the following objects:

-   `UI_PREFIX` constant: allows to specify the prefix for all the classes;
-   `SIZES` list: list some sizes used by components (i.e. buttons and icons);
-   `config` object: defines methods to get the current page location and the tag to use
    as default for the `Link` component.

You will probably like to set them by using `setConfig` helper to use for example `react-router`
utilities and `Link` component.

`index.js` files imports all components, hooks and utils and exports them, to be used form other projects.

### Components folder

All the components are placed inside the `components` folder, each one inside it's own folder.
Each component folder contains the component itself, the related style,
the tests file(s) and the Storybook file.

A special mention is the `forms` folder, that contains all the forms related components.
It also contains it's "own" `index.js` file where all the components are imported.

All the components are then imported/exported in `index.js` file,
so you will be able to import them like `import { Text } from '@borrow-ui/ui'`;

To use forms components you will need to import the `Forms` first, and use the components from it:

```js
import { Forms, Title } from '@borrow-ui/ui/lib';

const { Input, Textarea } = Forms;
```

### Hooks folder

The hooks folder contains useful and reusable hooks.

### Style folder

The style folder contains all globals `scss` variables and a `ui.full.scss` files that imports all the
single component's files.
Alternatively, you can import the style files directly in the components but you will not be able to
take advantage of sass customization in your other projects where the style is imported.

The style folder looks like this:

```
mixins/
    _icons.scss
vars/
    _colors.scss
    _main.scss
    _shadows.scss
_content.scss
_global.scss
_helpers.scss
_prefix.scss
colors.scss
ui.full.scss
ui.scss
```

The `mixins` folder contains usful mixins that are used in different components.

`vars` folder contains all the variables:

-   `_colors.scss` defines the colors used in the application;
-   `_main.scss` defines all the variables;
-   `_shadows.scss` defines variables for shadows.

`_helpers.scss` defines all the helpers: from padding to margin, height and width, flex shortcuts.

`_prefix.scss` contains the prefix name for all classes **and should match `config.UI_PREFIX` JS constant**.

`colors.scss` defines the colors classes.

All the variables and main `scss` files are imported in `ui.scss` file.
The `ui.scss` file itself and all the components files are imported in `ui.full.scss` file.

### Utils folder

The `utils` folder contains utility files:

-   `a11y.js` contains accessibility helper functions;
-   `constants.js` contains constants used in different moduels;
-   `filters.js` contains helper functions to filter list of objects (used by `SearchBar` component);
-   `types.js` contains reusable PropTypes;
