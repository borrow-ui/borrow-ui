description: Another blog post, with one component
---

This is another blog post loaded from an mdx file.

As well as the other posts, we can use our component library!

<Tabs
    tabs={[
        { label: 'First tab', content: `This is JSX content, not MDX` },
        { label: 'Second tab', content: `Again, not an MDX content here` },
    ]}
/>

<div className="m-t-20">
    This content is in JSX inside a div, and we can use other components too, link a{' '}
    <Button mean="neutral-reverse" onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>
        Button
    </Button>
</div>
