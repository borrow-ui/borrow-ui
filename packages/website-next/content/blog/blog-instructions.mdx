The first post of this blog!

Each blog post file can have few attributes:

-   `isPublished`: a boolean that determines if the post will show up in the list;
-   `postDate`: the date of the post;
-   `author`: the author of the post;
-   `description`: a brief description shown in the home page.

You can extend the basic tags just by adding them in the `.mdx` files and then
handling them in the `[slug].js`.

All the logic can be placed there, for example to show author and date only if the name
of the file is different from `index`.

Each slug then must correspond to the `.mdx` file (usually) placed in `content/section`
folder. All the blog entries, for example, are placed inside `content/blog` folder and each
file name will be used as URL slug.

The slug file has three important exports:

-   the `getStaticProps` function, which will generate the props for the content component,
    by reading the correspondent `.mdx` file;
-   the `getStaticPaths` function, which generates a list of possible slugs
    from the content folder;
-   the main component, exported as `default`, which consumes the generated props.

The two functions are "generated" by passing a content folder.

The `core/mdx` folder contains two files used to facilitate the generation of multiple slug pages
and a list of components used to override the basic HTML ones (for example, to use
the library `Title` component instead of `h*`).

And of course, you can use the library components and styles as well!

<div className="p-20 m-20 flex-center-center">
    <Loader />
</div>
