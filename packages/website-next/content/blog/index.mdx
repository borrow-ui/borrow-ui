This section is built using two JS files:

-   `index.js`: loads this file and then renders the list of posts;
-   `[slug].js`: the main slug manager, which loads the correspondent file from the content folder.

The content of each page is written in MDX and is loaded from `content/blog` folder.

If you want to create a new section with a simpler index file that just loads mdx,
a slug file needs to be created, and the `index.js` file
has to import the necessary function and component from the slug file.
In this scenario, the index page should be treated as a special case of slug,
otherwise Next.js would consider it literally (i.e. `/blog/index`).

An example can be found in the "Project" section.
