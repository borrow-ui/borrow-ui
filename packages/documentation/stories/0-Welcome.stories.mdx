# Welcome

Welcome to `borrow-ui` guide!

In this guide you will learn how to get ready to start using the components
and the other utilities included in this project.

Before you start, make sure you have a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) environment ready.
We will use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and, optionally, [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

You can use `borrow-ui` in different ways: by including the `src` folder or using this project as a base.
In the future will be possible to install `borrow-ui` from the npm registry.

## Goal of this project

`borrow-ui` project is intended to be a quick-start for a full controlled set of components.
Often when we start a new project we can't or won't use 3rd-party UI Kits such as
Material UI, UI Kit or React Bootstrap; each of these is great and is ready to use, with
a lot of documentation and examples.
However, there is almost no control over the components that are given. Small fixes or changes, or
systematic improvements are controlled by the Kit managers and might take a lot of time before
they are available.

`borrow-ui` allows you to start and maintain your own Kit. Each component:

- is minimal and can be used as a starter for more complex scenarios;
- is consistent with other comonents (code styles, tests, nomenclatures);
- is tested (TODO: [#39](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/issues/39));
- has a documentation file written for [`Storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/);
- usually has no 3rd party dependencies\*.

\* except for `flexboxgrid2` and `react-media`, which are easily swappable with others,
and the ones used in forms, `react-select`, `react-dropzone`, `react-day-picker` and `dayjs`.

### Tools and dependencies

Beside the components, `borrow-ui` offers tests (in form of snapshots and unit tests) and
documentation. As soon as your project is renamed as you wish, you will have this same
documentation available. It is strongly recommended to invest time documenting your components,
as well as testing them.

Styling is done with [scss](https://sass-lang.com/) and few variables can help to customize the Kit.

## Installation

As mentioned above, there are different ways to install and use `borrow-ui`.

- [include](/introduction/getting-started-include-in-an-existing-project)
  the `ui`'s `src` folder directly in your existing project:
  this will allow you to import and use all the components directly;
- [use this monorepo](/introduction/getting-started-use-as-a-project-base) as a base for your project,
  with storybook and examples already setup;
- by installing it from `npm` registry (`yarn add @borrow-ui/ui` or `npm install @borrow-ui/ui`).

All the installation procedures are explained in the next section.
