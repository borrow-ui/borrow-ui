# Add a component

If you want to add a new component you can do it with few easy steps.

First, add a new folder under `src/components`.
In the main `index.js` file import the new component, and finally import the style in `ui.full.scss`.

In the following paragraphs we will see how to add a `RedLink` component.

### Add the Component

Create a folder called `red-link` inside `src/components` and a file called `RedLink.js` inside it.

_There are other strategies to name components folders and files._
_For example, you can name the folder RedLink and the js file `index.js`, but in my opinion this makes it harder to open the files by the name and it's less immediate to determine the source of errors in the console_

Add the following code:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

// import the UI classes Prefix value
import { UI_PREFIX } from "../../config";
// import children prop type definition
import { propTypesChildren } from "../../utils/types";

// define the style class with BEM style and the UI Prefix
const LINK_CLASS = `${UI_PREFIX}__link`;

// Create the component and export it
export function RedLink({ className = "", children, ...rest }) {
  // define the class and remember to append the one coming from props
  const linkClassName = `${LINK_CLASS} ${className}`;

  // return the JSX
  return (
    // remember to append ...rest spread
    <a className={linkClassName} {...rest}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}

// Define the prop types
RedLink.propTypes = {
  className: PropTypes.string,
  children: propTypesChildren,
};
```

### Add the style

In the same folder, create a `red-link.scss` file, and add the following content:

```scss
/* import variables, like colors and ui-prefix */
@import "../../vars/main";

/* define the classes with the prefix */
.#{$ui-prefix}__link {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
.#{$ui-prefix}__link:hover {
  color: red;
}
```

### Import and export the files

Now that we have a component and it's style, we need to add them to:

- `src/index.js` file:

```jsx
// ... other components imports
import { RedLink } from "./components/red-link/RedLink.js";

export {
  // ... other components exports
  RedLink,
};
```

- `src/style/ui.full.scss` file:

```scss
/* other components imports */
@import "./components/red-link/red-link";
```

### Use the component

To use the new component in another project while developing, run (from `packages/ui` folder):

```bash
yarn watch
```

and import the component in your file (i.e. `packages/website/src/pages/Home.js`):

```jsx
import { RedLink } from "@borrow-ui/ui";
```

To use the component in another project in production, you will need to build first:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Adding tests

_This section of the guide is still in progress_

### Adding documentation

To document your components comments are always useful, of course!
Another great way of documenting your code is with dedicated tools.
The tool that comes with this package is Docz, so ideally we need to add a Docz
file to each of our components, to document it's usage to ourself and other developers.

To add a Docz mdx file for the component, create a `src/components/red-link/RedLink.stories.mdx` file:

```mdx
import { Meta, Story, Canvas, ArgsTable } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

import { RedLink } from "./RedLink";

<Meta title="Components/Link" component={RedLink} />

# RedLink

RedLink component creates a link that is always red.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <div>
      Look! a <RedLink href="/url">red link</RedLink>!
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={RedLink} />
```

To see it in the documentation, run (from `packages/documentation` folder):

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Build the documentation

Documentation can be built by running Docz build command (from `packages/documentation` folder):

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```
