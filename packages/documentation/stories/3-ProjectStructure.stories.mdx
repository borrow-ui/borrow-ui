# Project Structure Introduction

This project is based on [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and
[yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces).
This two tools allows to organise the project as a monorepo, have a minimal
impact on installed dependencies and link the packages inside the project
with a minimal effort, without the need to publish them.

Having different packages allows to re-use the same compnent library in
different projects, or be ready to do so in the future.

If you do not plan to expand your project with different packages, you might
want to [include](/introduction/getting-started-include-in-an-existing-project)
this component library instead of using this repository as a base.

This monorepo has the following structure:

```
borrow-ui/
  lerna.json
  package.json
  packages/
    ui/
      package.json
    documentation/
      package.json
    website/
      package.json
```

You can notice that there are different `package.json` files, on two levels:

- the one at the top level tells to `yarn` where to find the packages and define the main folder as a private package,
  to prevent accidental pushes to a registry;
- the ones inside the packages folders are the "standard" `package.json` files, with the commands and dependencies
  valid for the related package.

Inside the packages you can add other packages as dependencies and `yarn` will be smart enough to link them.

In this scenario, `lerna` will be useful as a publishing tool and to optimize packages management.

The main package of this project is the `ui` package (it's full path is `borrow-ui/packages/ui`).

Go to the [next section](/project-structure/ui-package) to see how it is organised.
