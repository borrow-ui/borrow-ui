# Use as a project base

`borrow-ui` can be used as a monorepo project base. It is already configured to
use the `ui` package inside the other packages.

This project is setup to work with [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
and [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces).

The following packages are included:

-   `ui`: the components library;
-   `website`: public website presenting the project;
-   `example-dashboard`: a dashboard backbone example; [TODO #4](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/issues/4)

To understand how a monorepo works, you can read the official documentation on lerna
home page, or one of the many tutorials.

## Step by step

### Download and rename the project

Download the latest zip [here](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/archive/master.zip)
and extract the content, for example in `~Downloads/borrow-ui-master`.

Copy and rename the package anywhere, like in `~repositories/my-ui-name`.
Delete the packages you don't need, for example `packages/website`.

Now, with your favourite editor (a [script is planned](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/issues/5))
rename all the occurrencies of `borrow-ui` to `my-ui-name`.

### Install dependencies

From the main folder, run:

```bash
yarn # this will install lerna
lerna bootstrap # this will install all the dependencies and link the packages
```

#### Initialize the git repository

Advice: initialize the folder as a repository and set a remote origin; if you are using github, you
can create an empty repository directly on the website and the run the following command:

```bash
git init
git add
git commit -m "Started project from @borrow-ui"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Start developing the components

The `packages/ui` folder contains the components and their styles, along with this guide and the tests.

There are few commands you can use to develop your components. From `packages/ui` folder, you can run:

-   `yarn watch` to start build and watch for file changes. This option is the preferred one during development,
    so you can immediatlely see the changes when importing the project from other packages. This version is not minified,
    but does not include peer dependencies (like `react-select` or `react-media`), so they must be installed in your
    application if you want to use the relative components. For a list of all peer dependencies,
    see "peerDependencies" section in the [package.json](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/blob/master/packages/ui/package.json) file;
-   `yarn storybook` to start [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server in development mode.
    If you use Storybook, you can develop your components without the watcher or other projects as it looks for changes
    in your folders. Remember to document your components!
-   `yarn test --watchAll` to run tests and watch for changes.

Production commands are very similar to the standard list of commands for any React project:

-   `yarn build` to build the component library and allow the other packages to use it.
    This version is minified and contains only the components and `flexboxgrid2`, so all other packages
    must be installed in your application
    (see "peerDependencies" section in the [package.json](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/blob/master/packages/ui/package.json) file);
-   `yarn test` to launch the tests without watcher.

### Add new packages

Since we are using yarn workspaces, new packages must be added with a specific command.
For example, if you want to add `react-dropzone` dependency to `website` package, run this command from the main folder:

```bash
yarn workspaces @borrow-ui/website add react-dropzone
```

Where:

-   `@borrow-ui/website` is the name of the website package as defined in website's `package.json` file under `name`;
-   `react-dropzone` is the name of the new dependency.

Of course you can add `-D` or `--dev` flag to install the dependency as a Dev Dependency.

To remove a package, use `remove` instead of `add`:

```bash
yarn workspaces @borrow-ui/website remove react-dropzone
```

Sometimes when you are developing and have one or more watcher enabled, you might have to run
`lerna bootstrap` command from the main folder again to relink the packages and restart the watchers.
