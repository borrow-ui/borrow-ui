# Include in an existing project

`borrow-ui` can be used directly in your React project by including the
`ui/src` folder of this project directly in your `src` folder.

For example, if you are using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/)):

1. copy the `borrow-ui/packages/ui/src` folder inside CRA's' `src` folder with the desired name
   (i.e. `@borrow-ui/ui`);
2. install the dependencies;
3. start the application

## Step by step

### Download and include in your project

Download the latest zip [here](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/archive/master.zip)
and extract the content, for example in `~Downloads/borrow-ui-master`.

Copy the `packages/ui/src` folder inside your project:

```bash
# Navigate inside your project src
cd my-react-project/src;
# create a @borrow-ui container folder
mkdir @borrow-ui
# copy the src folder inside the packages here
cp -r ~/Downloads/borrow-ui-master/packages/ui/src @borrow-ui/ui
```

### Install dependencies

Now, before starting the React app, the required dependencies needs to be installed.
You can check which are the "dependencies" and "peerDependencies" from the source
[package.json]() file and install them or launch the following command:

```bash
yarn add -D node-sass
yarn add flexboxgrid2 react-media material-design-icons-iconfont typeface-lato
# if you want to use forms:
yarn add react-select react-day-picker react-dropzone
```

If you don't want to use forms components, you need to remove the import and export
from `borrow-ui`'s `index.js` file, probably located now in `src/@borrow-ui/ui/index.js`:

```jsx
import { Card } from './components/card/Card';
// import { Forms } from './components/forms';
import { Row, Col } from './components/grid/Grid';

export {
    Col,
    // Forms,
    Icon,
};
```

Import in your application the required dependencies, for example in your main `src/index.js`:

```jsx
import 'typeface-lato';
import '@borrow-ui/ui/style/ui.full.scss';
import 'material-design-icons-iconfont/dist/material-design-icons.css';
```

### Import components in your project

Congratulations! You should be able now to import components from `@borrow-ui/ui`!

```jsx
import { Text } from '@borrow-ui/ui';
```

_Note: if you don't have setup absolute imports, you will need to specify a relative path_
