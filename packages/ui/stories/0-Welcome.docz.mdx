# Welcome

Welcome to `borrow-ui` guide!

In this guide you will learn how to get ready to start using the components
and the other utilities included in this package.

Before you start, make sure you have a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) environment ready.
We will use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and, optionally, [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

You can use `borrow-ui` in different ways: by including the `src` folder or using this project as a base.
In the future will be possible to install `borrow-ui` from the npm registry.

<!--
Each approach has it pros and cons: if you don't need to edit the components
you can install them or just install it via packange manager, however the purpose of this
project is to use the included files as a starter for your project.
-->

### Installation

As mentioned above, there are different ways to install and use `borrow-ui`.

-   [include](/introduction/getting-started-include-in-an-existing-project)
    the `src` folder directly in your existing project;
-   [use this monorepo](/introduction/getting-started-use-as-a-project-base) as a base for your project;
-   by installing it from `npm` registry (TODO: [#3](https://github.com/borrow-ui/borrow-ui/issues/3)).
