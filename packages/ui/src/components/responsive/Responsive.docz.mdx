# Responsive

`Responsive` is a wrapper around `Media` component from [`react-media`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media).
If the CSS media query changes, the `matches` prop is updated accordingly.

The wrapper has been created in order to provide default queries, that can be changed in `Responsive` component file.

The following text will have different class applied based on size:

-   "small" query: `color-accent`;
-   "medium" query: `color-primary`;
-   "large" query: no class.

Default queries constant is defined as follows, and can be customized with `queries` prop:

```jsx
const DEFAULT_QUERIES = {
    small: '(max-width: 599px)',
    medium: '(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1199px)',
    large: '(min-width: 1200px)',
};
```

<Playground>
    <Responsive>
        {(matches) => (
            <div className={matches.small ? 'color-accent' : matches.medium ? 'color-primary' : ''}>
                <Lorem />
            </div>
        )}
    </Responsive>
</Playground>
