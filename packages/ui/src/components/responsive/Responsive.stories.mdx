# Responsive

`Responsive` is a wrapper around `Media` component from [`react-media`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media).
If the CSS media query changes, the `matches` prop is updated accordingly.

The wrapper has been created in order to provide default queries, that can be changed in `Responsive` component file.

The following text will have different class applied based on size:
- "small" query: `color-accent`;
- "medium" query: `color-primary`;
- "large" query: no class.

Default queries constant is defined as follows, and can be customized with `queries` prop:
```jsx
const DEFAULT_QUERIES = {
    small: '(max-width: 599px)',
    medium: '(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1199px)',
    large: '(min-width: 1200px)',
};
```


<Preview>
    <Story name="Default">
        <div className="storybook-container">
            <Responsive>
                {matches => <div className={matches.small ? 'color-accent' : matches.medium ? 'color-primary' : ''}>
                    <Lorem />
                </div>
                }
            </Responsive>
        </div>
    </Story>
</Preview>
