# Link

Links are used to create connections between pages and to external content.
The `Link` component can be used as a standard link (`a` tag)
or customized to use another component (like `react-router-dom`'s `Link`).

<Playground>
    <div>
        A normal link with "a" tag <Link>looks like this</Link>.
    </div>
</Playground>

By default the link is underlined, but the decoration can be turned off by
using the `underline` property:

<Playground>
    <div>
        A link without underline <Link underline={false}>looks like this</Link>.
    </div>
</Playground>

## Default tag

The default tag is `a` tag and it is obtained from config function called `getLinkComponent`.
This is a function that returns a valid component or tag.

The setting can be changed with config setter function called `setConfig`.
In your `App.js` or `index.js` file you can call the function and set your custom one:

```jsx
import { Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router-dom';
import { setConfig } from '@borrow-ui/ui';

setConfig('getLinkComponent', () => RouterLink);

export default function App() {
    // ...
}
```

This can always be overridden by specifying the `tag` prop.

## Props

<Props of={Link} />
