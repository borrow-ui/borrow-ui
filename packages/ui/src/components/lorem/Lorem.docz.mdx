# Lorem

When developing pages sometimes is useful to have pre-generated text as placeholder.
The `Lorem` component can be used precisely for this.

A `paragraphs` prop can be used to specify how many text paragraphs should be rendered (from 1 to 3).

<Playground>
    <div>
        <Lorem paragraphs={3} />
    </div>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Lorem} />
