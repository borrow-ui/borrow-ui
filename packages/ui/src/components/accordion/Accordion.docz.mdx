# Accordion

Accordions allow to show and hide content by clicking on their title bar.
An Accordion can be open or closed at start.
By default, accordions start closed.

It is possible to customize both the title and the content container via `titleProps` and `contentProps`.

To have the transition animation a `max-height` value is required.
It is set in the CSS, but in case the default value is not enough it can be overridden via `maxHeight` props.

<Playground>
    <Accordion title="Accordion title">
        <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
            <Lorem />
        </div>
    </Accordion>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Accordion} />
