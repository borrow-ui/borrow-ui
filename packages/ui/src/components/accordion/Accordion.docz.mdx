# Accordion

Accordions allow to show and hide content by clicking on their title bar.
An Accordion can be open or closed at start.
By default, accordions start closed.

It is possible to customize both the title and the content container via `titleProps` and `contentProps`.

To have the transition animation a `max-height` value is required.
It is set in the CSS, but in case the default value is not enough it can be overridden via `maxHeight` props.

<Playground>
    <Accordion title="Accordion title">
        <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
            <Lorem />
        </div>
    </Accordion>
</Playground>

## Props

## React Tutorial

Accordion component is relative simple.
The main elements are the title and the content, both wrapped into their containers.

The idea is that clicking on the title the content shuold swap visibilty.
For example, if the content is not visible, clicking the title should make it visible.

To achieve this we can use a state variable and show/hide the content accordingly:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export function Accordion({ title, children }) {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false); // make content hidden by default

    return (
        <div>
            <div onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>{title}</div>
            <div style={{ display: isOpen ? 'block' : 'none' }}>{children}</div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

We can then customize the initial state with another prop: `initialStatus`.
This can have more explicit values rather than just a boolean, such as `open` or `closed`:

```jsx
export function Accordion({ title, initialStatus, children }) {
    // Initialization based on initialStatus prop
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(initialStatus === 'open');

    // ... same as before
}
```
