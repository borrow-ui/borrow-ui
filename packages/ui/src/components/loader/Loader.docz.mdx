# Loader

Loaders are usually used when some content is not available and a
process needs to be completed.

There are two loader types available: `full-section` and `inline`.

<Playground>
    <div>
        <Loader />
    </div>
</Playground>

The inline one can be put within other content:

<Playground>
    <div>
        <div>
            This is inline <Loader type="inline" /> with content.
        </div>
        <div>
            It can also be used inside a button:
            <Button disabled={true} mean="regular-reverse">
                <Loader type="inline" />
                Loading
            </Button>
        </div>
    </div>
</Playground>

## Props

Note: the `...rest` spread is passed to the loader container.

<Props of={Loader} />
