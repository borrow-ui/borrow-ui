# Title

`Title` component is used to create titles in a consistent way.

By default, `h1` tag is used, but can be overridden by specifying `tag` prop.

<Playground>
    <Title>Title example</Title>
    <Lorem />
</Playground>

Title can be also used as anchor. An `a` wrapper tag is used if `anchor` prop (anchor's name) is passed.
The anchor class can be customized with `anchorClassName` prop.

<Playground>
    <Title anchor="title-1">Anchor title</Title>
    <Lorem />
    <Title anchor="title-2" anchorClassName="color-primary">
        Anchor title with custom class
    </Title>
    <Lorem />
</Playground>

## Title Props
