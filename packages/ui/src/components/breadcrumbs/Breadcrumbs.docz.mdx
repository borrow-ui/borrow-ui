# Breadcrumbs

`Breadcrumbs` component is used to display the page path, usually from home.

It expects a list of objects with a mandatory `label` key, and an optional `link`.
If the link is not present the breadcrumb will be added just as a label
(usually the last element does not have a link).

<Playground>
    <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
            { label: 'Home', link: '/url/to/home' },
            { label: 'List of Tests', link: '/url/to/list-of-tests' },
            { label: 'Selected test' },
        ]}
    >
        <h2>Selected test 123</h2>
    </Breadcrumbs>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Breadcrumbs} />
