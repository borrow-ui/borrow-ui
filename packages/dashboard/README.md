# Dashboard

This project contains a Dashboard based on `borrow-ui` and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Dashboard has:

-   a landing page;
-   a folder with common components;
-   two applications, to show how to organise the code for multiple apps;
-   no memory (database): everything is restored after refresh.

## Commands

To start the dashboard in development mode, run

```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the Dashboard on the default CRA address, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To build the project, run

```bash
yarn build
```
